# Git and GitHub:  What's the Difference?  

**Git** is a system for version control. It runs at the command line on your local machine and allows you to keep track of your files and modifications in a "repository".

**GitHub** is a website that allows you to upload your git respositories online. It allows you to have a backup of your files, has a visual interface to navigate your repos, and it allows other people (us!) to be able to view your repos.

# Set up your repository on GitHub


## Step 1: Sign up for GitHub

You will need a GitHub account.

It's easy and free to [sign up](https://github.com/join).


## Step 2: Sign in to GitHub

Make sure that you are [signed in](https://github.com/login) to GitHub.


## Step 3: Fork this repository

Click the **Fork** button at the upper right hand corner of the page:

This makes a personal copy of the repository that you can edit. Your forked copies will show up in your *Repositories* section.

This repository is `thisismetis/dsp`. Your forked copy will be `your_github_user_name/dsp`.


## Step 4: Edit your fork  

There are files in your forked repository that you need to edit to add your work.

When viewing an individual file in your forked repository on GitHub, you will an see "Edit this file" button that you can click to get an in-browser editor.

After you've edited the file, you need to _commit_ your changes to make them permanent. At the bottom of the page you can add a _commit message_ describing your changes and then click the green "Commit changes" button.

You can repeat the edit and commit process as many times as you like. You don't have to be totally done with a file to commit. Commit incrementally!

Here's your first chance to practice this:

### [What Is Markdown? 4 Reasons Why You Should Learn It Now](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/markdown-4-reasons-learn-now/)  
Markdown is a simple way to add formatting — like headers, bold/italic text, and lists — to plain text. Rather than relying on HTML or WYSIWYG editors, Markdown allows you to create full pages of formatted text without ever having to remove your fingers from the keyboard, and all in a way that’s much more intuitive than HTML.

#### Q1.  
What is the most installed language in the world?

>>According to [ZDNet](http://www.zdnet.com/article/which-programming-languages-are-most-popular-and-what-does-that-even-mean/) 
the most popular language is Java. However, given that it's not on the list above, and ZDNet's next three are C, Python, and 
C++ (respectively), I'm going to go with Python.
